# Native Android and iOS app

The Ionic client uses Capacitor 8 with bundled assets in `mobile/dist`. Native source
is versioned in `mobile/android` and `mobile/ios`. Run the commands below from
the repository root containing `mobile/`, `server/`, and `vercel.json`.

## API connection

Create the ignored `mobile/.env.native`:

```dotenv
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://gorav2.vercel.app
```

Use the public origin of the existing GORA deployment, without `/api/v1`. The phone
must be able to reach it over HTTPS. Native builds validate this setting; browser
builds still support same-origin API routes and the local Vite proxy.

`CapacitorHttp` is enabled for native `fetch`/XHR networking to the separately
hosted API. The deployed API currently omits an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
header for `https://localhost`; native HTTP avoids that browser CORS restriction.
If you disable native HTTP, add `https://localhost` (Android) and
`capacitor://localhost` (iOS) to the API's `CORS_ORIGIN` and redeploy it.

Configure `LIVE_TURN_URLS`
and `LIVE_TURN_SECRET` on the API for calls between restrictive mobile networks;
see [TURN setup](turn-setup.md). Do not put TURN secrets in the client environment.

## Android

Install Node 22+, Android Studio 2025.2.1+, SDK platform 36, and its build tools.
Use Android Studio's bundled JDK 21 (or newer compatible JDK).

```powershell
npm install --prefix mobile
npm run mobile:android
npm run mobile:android:open
```

In Android Studio, run on a connected phone or build an APK using **Build >
Generate App Bundles or APKs > Generate APKs**. For an already configured Android
toolchain, `mobile/android/gradlew.bat -p mobile/android assembleDebug` builds a
debug APK at `mobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.
Run `npm run mobile:android` again after frontend changes before rebuilding.

The app ID is `com.gora.app`. Keep it consistent with any existing store listing
before publishing. Release signing is configured separately in Android Studio.

## iOS

On a Mac with Xcode 26+, run `npm run mobile:ios`, then
`npm run ios:open --prefix mobile`. Select your signing team and a physical device
in Xcode. The project uses Swift Package Manager. Windows can maintain the source
but cannot compile or sign an iOS app.

## Camera, microphone, and verification

Go Live and video calls request camera + microphone through `getUserMedia`; voice
calls request microphone only. Capacitor's built-in WebView bridge requests Android
runtime permissions. Android declares `CAMERA`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, and
`MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS`; iOS declares camera and microphone usage descriptions.
There is no still-photo Camera plugin in the streaming path: WebRTC needs live
`MediaStream` tracks. Permissions are requested after a media action, not at launch.

On two physical devices with different accounts, verify:

1. Open Go Live, allow both permissions, and check the preview and viewer sound.
2. Make/answer a voice call; confirm no camera permission is required.
3. Make/answer a video call and toggle microphone/camera.
4. Deny a permission, check the message, then grant it in app settings and retry.
5. End calls/broadcasts and navigate away; camera/microphone indicators must turn off.
6. Repeat over Wi-Fi and mobile data to verify the deployed TURN relay.

Calls and broadcasts currently require the app to stay open. Incoming calls are
polled while the app is visible; background/terminated-app ringing needs push and
native calling integration, which is separate from media permissions.
